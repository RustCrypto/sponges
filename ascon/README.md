Pure Rust implementation of the permutation of [Ascon], a family of
authenticated encryption and hashing algorithms designed to be lightweight and
easy to implement.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

Ascon is a family of lightweight algorithms built on a core permutation
algorithm. These algorithms include:

- [x] [`ascon-aead`]: Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
- [x] [`ascon-hash`]: Hash functions and extendible-output functions (XOF)
- [ ] Pseudo-random functions (PRF) and message authentication codes (MAC)

Ascon has been selected as [new standard for lightweight cryptography] in the
[NIST Lightweight Cryptography] competition, and has also been selected as the
primary choice for lightweight authenticated encryption in the final
portfolio of the [CAESAR competition].

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate requires **Rust 1.56** at a minimum.

We may change the MSRV in the future, but it will be accompanied by a minor
version bump.
